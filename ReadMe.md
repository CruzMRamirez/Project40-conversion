# Guide to creating a Read.md file 
The above is using the first header text. It's the same as using an H1 in html format. To use it, use the # sign to determine the header type. For Example: `# This is an H1`
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
##### This is an H5
###### This is an H6

Alternatively you may use the html syntax

<h1>This is an H1 using the html tags</h1>

For the body, you can just type normally in a new line or use the html p tag

Next thing you should know is how to **bold** and can be done like this or like this __bold__
`**Bold**` or `__bold__ ` or even like this `This**is**Bold` to get This**is**Bold 
Just as headers you may also use the html tags

For the intalics, use a single `*`. *this should be in italics.* you may also use single underscores`_`

Use three of either `*` or `_` to do both italics and bold. ***This should be both in italics and bold***

to use blockquotes use the `>` symbol and can be used to nest them by adding more of the symbols
`use > in the first line and use >> for the second line` 
> this is a block quote
>> this is inside a block quote

for lists you can use numbers and for unordered lists you can use hyphens

1. list item 1
2. list item 2
    1. list item a
3. list item 3
1. list item 4

- item
- item
- item
    - item
- item


use three `***` to make a line

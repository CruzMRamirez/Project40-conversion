The above is using the first header text. It's the same as using an H1 in html format. To use it, use the # sign to determine the header type. For Example: `# This is an H1`
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
##### This is an H5
###### This is an H6

Alternatively you may use the html syntax

<h1>This is an H1 using the html tags<h1>
